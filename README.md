# Nullish Coalescing Operator is sometimes informally referred to as the "Elvis Operator"

It seems like there might be a confusion in terminology. The "Elvis Operator" is not a standard term in JavaScript. However, there is a similar concept known as the "nullish coalescing operator," which is sometimes informally referred to as the "Elvis Operator" due to its resemblance to the eyes and hair of Elvis Presley.

The nullish coalescing operator (??) is used to provide a default value for a variable if its current value is **`null`** or **`undefined`**. It is a shorthand way of writing a conditional statement.

Here's a simple example:

```javascript
let myVariable = someValue ?? defaultValue;
```

In this example, if **`someValue`** is **`null`** or **`undefined`**, **`myVariable`** will be assigned the value of **`defaultValue`**. Otherwise, it will be assigned the value of **`someValue`**.

It's important to note that the nullish coalescing operator specifically checks for **`null`** or **`undefined`** and does not include other falsy values like **`0`**, **`false`**, an empty string **`''`**, etc. If you want to include those values as well, you might use the logical OR operator (**`||`**), but be cautious as it has different behavior with falsy values.
